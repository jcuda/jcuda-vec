Vector operations for JCuda

This library offers utility methods for performing vector operations with
single- or double precision floating point, using [JCuda](http://www.jcuda.org).

The [SampleVecDouble](https://github.com/jcuda/jcuda-vec/blob/master/src/test/java/jcuda/vect/SampleVecDouble.java)
and [SampleVecFloat](https://github.com/jcuda/jcuda-vec/blob/master/src/test/java/jcuda/vect/SampleVecFloat.java)
classes show the basic usage of this library.
